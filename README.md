# Dependencies

Namely, the programs that have to be installed in order for the configuration to not go wrong.

## Hyprland Configuration Dependencies

Basically everything can be installed by `yay`.


1. [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), of course. If you are using Arch linux, you can get it by doing `sudo pacman -S hyprland` or the git version `yay -S hyprland-git`, the latter needs [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) to be installed.

2. [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww) and [mpvpaper](https://github.com/GhostNaN/mpvpaper) wallpaper manager

3. [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) terminal
